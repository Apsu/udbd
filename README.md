UDBD
===

U(dev)DB(US)D(aemon) is a tool designed to listen for events from udev and dbus and do actions in
response to them, via user-configured and -provided plugins. The intended goal is to have a simple
collection of useful plugins, so that a non-privileged user can respond to events with user-oriented
actions. This allows for thin, lightweight event-driven behavior within a user's session,
environment and privileges.
